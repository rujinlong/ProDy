-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MechStiff
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    
  * Identification of the weakest/strongest elements of the structure 
    architecture provided together with 3D vizualization and statistics 
    analysis.
    
  * Determination of the effective spring constant for selected pair 
    of residues - useful for Single Molecule Force Spectroscopy (SMFS, AFM) 
    and Steered Molecular Dynamics simulations.
    
  * Evaluating the contributions of each mode to selected deformations

**New Features**:

*Python 2 and 3 Support*

  * ProDy has been refactored to support Python 2.7 and 3.4.  Windows installers for
    Python 2.7 and 3.4 are available in :ref:`getprody`.

  * Unit tests are compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.4, and running them with
    other versions gives errors due to unavailability of some :mod:`unittest`
    features.

*Bugfixes*

  * Various indexing issues are fixed. 

  * Compatibility issue of :func:`.searchPfam` with Python 2.7.11 is fixed.
